# Lab 2.3 - Deployment  

In this lab, you will need to:
* Create deployment imperatively and declaratively
* View and inspect the deployment that are currently in the namespace 
* Upgrade deployment to new version
* Check rollout status and rollout history
* Rollback to previous version
 
 
## Prerequisites  

Complete Lab 2.1 & Lab 2.2 before attempting this exercise. You will need to understand the concept of pods, replicaset, deployments and yaml. 

## Create Deployment 


1. Copy the following into an empty yaml file: 

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-1
spec:
   replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: nginx-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: nginx-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.7.8
```

Save the file as deployment1.yaml and run ```kubectl create -f deployment1.yaml```. You should see the following message: ```error: error parsing dep1.yaml: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 6: did not find expected key```.

2.  Note that the apiVersion for Deployment is the same as the apiVersion for ReplicaSet. Edit the yaml file and align the replicaset field with the selector field. Run ```kubectl create -f deployment1.yaml``` again. You should see the following message: ```deployment.apps/deployment-1 created```. 

   If the yaml file is unable to execute, an error message will be displayed. Common errors include identation issues, wrong use of apiVersion and incorrect labels. 


## View Deployment
1. To view the deployment that you have created in the current namespace, you can run the command ```kubectl get deployment```. For now let's run ```kubectl get all``` to see all the resources created by the deployment. You should see the following:

The "get all" command gives an overview of all the resources that are currently running in the namespace. Since deployment creates replicasets and the replicaset creates pods, we are able to see those resources in the namespace. 
</p>
   

2. To get more information on a particular deployment, run the command ```kubectl describe deployment```. You should see the following:

Take note of the version of nginx under the pod template section. The current image version is nginx:1.7.8. From the event section at the bottom, you will be able to see that a replicaset with 2 pods has been created successfully. 
 
## Upgrade Deployment 

There are 2 ways of upgrading deployments. The first way is to edit the yaml file, while the second is to edit it via the command line. 

1. Run ```kubectl set image deployment deployment-1 nginx-container=nginx:1.7.9```. You should see the following message: ```deployment.apps/deployment-1 image updated ```.  

2. Run ```kubectl rollout status deployment deployment-1```. You should see the following message: ```deployment "deployment-1" successfully rolled out```. The rollout command is used for checking the status of the rollout. 

3. Run ```kubectl describe deployment```. You should see the nginx version as nginx:1.7.9.

</p>
 
4. Run ```kubectl edit deployment deployment-1```. Go to nginx-container and change the version to ```nginx:1.7.8```. 

5. Run ```kubectl describe deployment``` and verify that the version is changed back to nginx:1.7.8.

## Rollback Deployment

1. Run ```kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-1```. You should see the message: ```deployment.apps/deployment-1 rolled back```. 

2. Run ```kubectl describe deployment``` and verify that the version is changed back to nginx:1.7.9. 
 
3. Run```kubectl set image deployment deployment-1 nginx-container=nginx:999```. Next, run ```kubectl rollout status deploy deployment-1```. You should see the message ```Waiting for deployment "deployment-1" rollout to finish: 1 out of 2 new replicas have been updated...```. Ctrl+C to terminate the command. 

4. Run ```kubectl get pods```. You should see the following: 
 
<p align="center">
<img width="789" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-12 at 5 46 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60460833/74323025-cc4e5780-4dbf-11ea-92d4-c8989fbc39dc.png"> 
 

   The reason that only 1 pod encountered an error is due to the fact that the pods are upgraded 1 at a time. This is the benefit of using rolling update. If there is a problem with your update, the error will not bring your system down. The remaining pods are still able to service your existing users.
</p>

 
5. Run ```kubectl describe deployment``` and verify that the version is nginx:999. Run ```kubectl rollout history deployment deployment-1``` . You should see a list of rollout history that you have done. Run ```kubectl rollout history deploy deployment-1 --revision=2```. You should be able to see a snippet of the pod template. 

6. Run ``` kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-1 --to-revision=2 ```. You should see the message: ```deployment.apps/deployment-1 rolled back```. Run ``` kubectl rollout status deploy deployment-1``` to verify that the deployment has been successfully rolled out.

## Delete Deployment

1. Next, let's delete the deployment. Run the command ```kubectl delete deployment deployment-1```. You should see the message: ```deployment.apps/deployment-1 deleted```. 
 

   Run ```kubectl get all```. You should no longer see the pods and replicaset that are associated with the deployment. 


# Congratulations! You have completed the Kubernetes Deployment exercise!
